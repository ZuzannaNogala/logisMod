\title{Finding points on the ROC curve corresponding to a choosen threshold}
\usage{
.findPointsOnTheROC(thresholds_sequance, model, strNameY)
}
\arguments{
\item{thresholds_sequance}{sequence of numeric values from 0 to 1, thresholds
of success' probability - if predicted probability of dependent variable is higher than treshold, the
event is counted as a success}

\item{model}{glm.object, logistic model build from data, which is data.table
object}

\item{strNameY}{characteristic, name of dependent variable which takes values
0 and 1}
}
\value{
a list of pairs represents FPR and TPR for each threshold probability
}
\description{
\code{.findPointsOnTheROC} computes a point which represents the False
Positive Rate (FPR) and the True Positive Rate (TPR, sensitivity) at each threshold
setting
